To run, make sure all files are in the right directory
Then, start with the TD3 agent and run that to get all those values correct
Following this, open the Trainagent file, and run this. This should automatically open the simulink and load the model
The rest are just support functions.
Make sure wind turbulence is set to a constant seed if you want to train the agent
The error sim runs simulation for 60s 20 times, just set the PID or agent to control the system
